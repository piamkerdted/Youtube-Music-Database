# Youtbe Music Database Project

This is a Youtube music database I created using SQL snd Python, which users can interact with through a GUI made with tkinter.
Functions include a search engine that allows users to look up songs and pieces in a convenient manner and gatekeeps content unrelated to music, and is intended for kids and the elderly who may be overwhelmed by the content and choices on Youtube. 

This script requires sqlite3 module for python.
